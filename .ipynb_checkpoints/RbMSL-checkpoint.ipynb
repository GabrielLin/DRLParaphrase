    "1. To train evaluator:\n",
    "    - Fix train.py to take in the data we want - no need to read_corpus, we just need to have pairs of (sent1, sent2, label) --> where label is 0 or 1\n",
    "        - Embeddings: Use the ones from the paper, there should be a function to load them\n",
    "2. To pre-train generator()\n",
    "    - Fix batcher.py\n",
    "        - modify text_generator() to extract question 1 and question 2 from tf.Example file IFF they have a positive label\n",
    "        - modify fill_example_queue() --> Possibly just name change of (article, abstract)\n",

    "    - Find a good monte carlo simulator library for this task? \n",
    "    - Function to compute value \n",
    "    - Make function to rescale Q value\n",
